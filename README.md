## Money-Love-Meter
This is the money and love meter, written by me to put into my bot Cassandra! This can be found in the snuggle command.
How it works is that you input your name, and then through a few random randomizers (they are called randomizers for a reason lol), you get a score, then the amount of hearts associated with the range of it!
Then it saves your results in a ".txt" document, "Shadi.txt" represents the tests I've done on this!
